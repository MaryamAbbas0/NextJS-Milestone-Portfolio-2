        Hello! I&apos;m Maryam Abbas, a dedicated and passionate learner, currently pursuing my journey in technology with a strong focus on artificial intelligence and web development. My fascination for technology drives me to constantly explore new trends and innovations in the field, enabling me to grow both as a student and an aspiring professional.

        I am currently affiliated with the Governor House, where I am committed to advancing my knowledge across multiple fields, including AI, IT, and web development frameworks like Next.js. Throughout my journey, I have successfully completed various courses that introduced me to cutting-edge technologies, enhancing my skill set and deepening my understanding of the ever-evolving tech landscape. My goal is not only to absorb information but also to apply it effectively in practical projects, which fuels my enthusiasm for continuous improvement.

        I believe in the power of technology to transform the world and am excited to contribute to this transformation. In addition to my technical pursuits, I am also dedicated to creating user-friendly and visually appealing websites, with a particular focus on building clean and responsive layouts using React, TypeScript, and CSS.

        Through my portfolio, I hope to showcase my skills, reflect my learning journey, and connect with like-minded professionals who are equally passionate about technology. Thank you for visiting, and I look forward to any opportunities where we can collaborate and learn from each other!
